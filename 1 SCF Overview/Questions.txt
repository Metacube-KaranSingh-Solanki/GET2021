Implementation of Shopping Cart

Creating a Shopping Cart Class Using Object-Oriented Programming in JAVA

At the bare minimum, the shopping card should contain:

1. The cart must store the items that have been put in the cart. Each item of the cart must have some price.
2. The items should be updatable (e.g., to change the quantity of an item in the cart, add/remove items from the cart etc).
3. The items need to be fetchable as well—for example, to display the cart’s contents. 
4. The cart should be kept rather generic to make it more universally usable.
5. The ability to generate the bill of the cart items.
